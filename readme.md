Here's my solutions to the assignments. I recommend trying them out on your own before just copying it straight away but it's your choice ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

P.S. I recommend running all the programs on linux as you wouldn't need to tinker with the firewall. Also use SO_REUSEPORT in your socket options.   
All the best for your CN course!
